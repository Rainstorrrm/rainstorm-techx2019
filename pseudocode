Toss the spitball
    if shot made, the ball would be detected, robo make noise to cele brate
  
If not made, use voice detection to wake up the robo, 
   robo waken up, 
      start spinning, start detecting for spitball
 
When spitball detected:
   stop spinning, stop detecting for spitball, approach spitball, activate ultrasonic  
  
When the distance of the spitball is smaller than a threshold (using ultrasonic):
   activate 舵机 
   close the arm to trap the spitball
   start spinning again, start looking for owner (which is represented by a colored board)
 
 When owner detected:
   stop spinning, approach owner
  
 When the distance between the robo and the owner is smaller than a threshold 
 ##not sure how to determine the distance yet##
    stop approaching, stop detecting for owner, rest for 5 seconds to let the owner to pick up the spitball 
    
 After 5 seconds (after the owner picks up the ball, which means that the task is completed):
    start spinning again, start detecting homebase (which is represented by a colored board)
 
 When homebase is detected:
    Stop spinning and detecting, approach homebase
    
 When the distance between the robo and the homebase is smaller than a threshold
 ##not sure how to determine the distance yet##
    stop approaching, rest
  
  REPEAT FROM THE TOP
